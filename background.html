<h1>This is about shift car</h1>
<p>Shift Cars can also be used by Kamen Rider Mach and Kamen Rider Chaser by inserting them into the Mach Driver Honoh. Unlike the Shift Brace, it doesn't require them to change the selected Shift Car into its Lever Mode to be inserted.

They are able to attack Roidmudes by traveling on special tracks that they spawn, and are strong enough to incapacitate un-evolved Roidmudes. As long as someone has a Shift Car on their person, they are able to ignore the time distortions a Roidmude emits when active, unless multiple time distortion effects occur. In this case, one must have multiple Shift Cars on their person. Episode 22 shows that they can also destroy Roidmude constructs, such as the fake murder victims, so much that they were addressed as "guardian spirits".

Their most unique attribute though is their capacity for sentience and sapience. Though they cannot speak, Shift Cars can feel emotions such as mischievousness, frustration, happiness and even more complicated feelings such as regret and loss, and can show these emotions through their beeping or through car signs they spawn alongside their tracks. Only Shinnosuke, Mr. Belt, and Kiriko are shown to be able to understand them so far. Other Special Investigation Unit members are also aware of their existence but dismiss them as Shinnosuke's toy cars, until they found out about his secret.
Shift Speed (シフトスピード, Shifuto Supīdo, Based on a sports car): Allows Drive to transform into Type Speed, granting him acceleration capabilities that enable him to move and attack at high velocities. Because Type Speed is Drive's main form, it doesn't need any special requirements or emotional frames of mind for Shinnosuke to access. In the toyline, there is also a golden version of the Shift Speed Car, but it works like a normal Shift Speed Car.
Shift Wild (シフトワイルド, Shifuto Wairudo, Based on a dune buggy): Allows Drive to transform into Type Wild, granting him enhanced strength and defensive capabilities. It can also transform Tridoron into its own Type Wild mode. Shinnosuke must be pumped up and motivated to fight in order to use Type Wild. In the toyline, there is also a golden version of the Shift Wild Car, but it works like a normal Shift Wild Car.
Shift Technic (シフトテクニック, Shifuto Tekunikku, Based on a garbage truck): Allows Drive to transform into Type Technic, granting him analyzing capabilities that enable him to either react with lightning speed to changes in the battlefield or control machines as well as multitask by using a pair of extra eyes in the back of his head. It can also transform Tridoron into its own Type Technic mode. Shinnosuke must have a cool, calm, and clear mind in order to use Type Technic. When the Tire Exchange Shift Cars went against Shinnosuke and the others, Shift Technic had to stay with Kiriko in order to allow her to move normally in a Slowdown.
Shift Deadheat (シフトデッドヒート, Shifuto Deddo Hīto, Based on a motorcycle and sidecar): A Shift Car/Signal Bike hybrid that allows Drive to transform into Type Dead Heat, enabling him to access the Dead Zone state. Shift Deadheat first appeared only as a sidecar part since Rinna still tried to complete it, but got sidetracked by personal problems. Later, it was completed by Harley Hendrickson. Usage of Shift Deadheat carries the risk of turning the Drive System into an out of control rampant and attack anyone around him. The only way to stop this is to strike Drive with either a finishing move or an attack strong enough to deactivate Shift Deadheat's influence on him so that he can cancel the transformation. Usage of Shift Deadheat can also enable its user to resist the effects of a Super Heavy Acceleration field, but with the drawback of its user's enhanced capabilities being restricted as well as taking a much heavier toll on their body. However, it still allows a normal human to escape. Unlike the other Type Change Shift Cars, Mr. Belt cannot communicate through Shift Deadheat. Like Shift Speed, it also doesn't require anything specific for Shinnosuke to access.</p>
